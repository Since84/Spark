			<h2>Thank You for Supporting Rights4Girls!</h2>
			<p>Our work would not be possible without supporters like you. Each dollar you donate helps achieve our goal of ending the cycle of violence against young women and girlsâ€“ whether they be victims of child sex trafficking, girls subject to solitary confinement in detention, or pregnant girls forced to give birth in shackles. </p>
