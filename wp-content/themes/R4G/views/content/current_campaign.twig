						<p>All too often, the media, law enforcement and others refer to victims as "child prostitutes," belittling the pain and abuse exploited girls endure on a daily basis.

Most girls are not even of legal age to consent to sex at all, let alone commercial sex. This has to change—in language and law.</p>
